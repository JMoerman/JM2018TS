# About this test suite

This test suite was designed and used for my bachelor thesis "Evaluating the performance of open source static analysis tools".
This test suite was inspired by, and used in conjunction with the test suite presented in "Test-driving static analysis tools in search of c code vulnerabilities" by George Chatzieleftheriou and Panagiotis Katsaros.
